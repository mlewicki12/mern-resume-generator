## Resume Generator

Full-stack app leveraging Node.js for the backend and React for the front
Very roughly styled atm more for use as a personal tool than for any public facing utility

# Back-end

Developed in Node using Express primarily for a quick setup and to avoid the overhead
associated with using .NET

Uses Liquid.js themes to turn build out json component input into a complete resume

# Front-end

Very rudimentary React app built as a means of interacting with the app than any public
facing use

Eventually will be restyled using tailwind.css and built out into a full web app
Currently missing asset upload/use and the ability to save resume input
